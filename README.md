# JS Reference

We will be collaboratively filling out this repository over the course of the bootcamp.

As we learn JS, each of you will create snippet study resources that go in depth on the language features you want to reinforce.

The purpose of this repo is to keep a communally curated javascript reference derived from what we've covered in class: 
* Each time you create one you think is especially good, add it!  
* If you see something is missing, make it and add it!
* Do you like what someone has done and want to build on it? fork, contribute, and pr!

This repo doesn't mean you should stop maintaining your own js reference repo. Yours is for your personal study, this one is for creating a history of we've covered in class.
